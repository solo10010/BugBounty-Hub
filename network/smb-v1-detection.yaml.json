"impact":"SMBv1 has a number of vulnerabilities that allow for remote code execution on the target machine. Even though most of them have a patch available and SMBv1 is no longer installed by default as of Windows Server 2016, hackers are still exploiting this protocol to launch devastating attacks. In particular, EternalBlue exploits a vulnerability in  SMBv1 â€” and just a month after EternalBlue was published, hackers used it to launch the infamous WannaCry ransomware attack. "
