"vulnerability_description":"A recently discovered vulnerability in Microsoftâ€™s remote desktop protocol (RDP) goes back to Windows Server 2012 R2 and lets anyone who can connect to an RDP session gain near total control over other RDP users, launching a man-in-the-middle attack.if an attacker can connect to RDP, all they need to do is create a duplicate pipe and wait for a new connection. RDP automatically connects to the service that was created first, so when a new user connects, the existing malicious pipe will be the one their machine automatically connects to. At that point, the attacker controls both ends of the pipe and can read, pass and modify data between the client and host.  ",
